                                <p class="pb-15">The idea is to blend the clothes and nature seamlessly. This is shown
                                    by a series ofimages which could be used to different variants of the products. We
                                    show three images of nature - Snowclad Mountain, Lush Green landscape, Sunny
                                    Dessert. While on first look it looks like an image of nature, but on closer, it
                                    becomes visible that the snow-clad mountain is not a mountain but a white cloth
                                    folded in the shape of a mountain. Similarly, in the green landscape, the green
                                    grass is actually a green towel, and the dessert sand dunes are nothing but a brown
                                    jacket.</p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <div class="col-md-6">
                                        <p>The visual shows how the clothes blend into nature just like what our product
                                            offers. The Tagline, “Blending the freshness of nature' reiterates the
                                            visual - blending the clothes with the nature freshness. The word blend also
                                            has another connotation. The comfort conditioner is BLENDED (mixed) with the
                                            washing powder to get the freshness of nature. The circle illustrated around
                                            the copy is an signifies the blending process of mixing of the conditioner
                                            with the clothes in the washing machine or bucket, incidentally both has
                                            circle circumference.</p>

                                <p class="pb-15"> There is a common thread between the product and the environment, like how there is a common thread
                                    between the human and its environment.</p>
                                <p class="pb-15">And the common thread is the Atom. We all are made up of atoms
                                    on different level.
                                    And the drink can is like atom, if opened, unleashes powerful energy to the
                                    consumer.</p>
                                <p><span>Atom - It is more Physical.</span></p>
                                <p>There are two connotations for this line. The first on is
                                    related to the ATOM part, where word signifies, the physical world, our surrounding
                                    and environment. The drink is produced organically; hence it says that the product
                                    has to do more with environment than with artificial flavour and ingredients etc.
                                    And, in the second, the word physical denotes the body and how the drinks helps them
                                    to do more physical work by giving them more energy.</p>

                                    lot of classified information are stored in the personal devices like mobile laptops
                                    desktops etc., Now, AXA, as a part of its reward program, offers its customers
                                    digital protection by providing an anti-virus software subscription valid for one
                                    year for one of their digital devices. The subscription gets renewed every year
                                    depending on the term of the insurance contract. So, if the contract is for 5 years,
                                    then the subscription is valid for five years; but would be renewed every year. And
                                    for customer who have more than 6 contracts, the annual subscription would be for
                                    multiple devices. This reward program essentially underlines the fact that AXA as an
                                    insurance company ensure the protection of its customer digital part as well.</p>

                                <p class="pb-15">Digital devices are an integral part of our life. everyone is on it
                                    for lot many purposes like social media, banking etc. where there is a high risk of
                                    information theft. In such a scenario, digital security is more than important now.
                                    And most people, though are aware of the impending risk, don't usually take concrete
                                    measure to make it secure. So, this reward defending an individual and his entire
                                    family against virus, malware, random ware etc., would be a perfect compliment as it

                                    ESET or McAfee or any other credible antivirus software company. An agreement has to
                                    be made where AXA brings in a certain amount of customer from its domain while the
                                    software company would provide the annual subscription at a nominal value which
                                    would benefit both the companies, in terms of increasing the customer base as well
                                    the revenue part.</p>

                                <p class="pb-15">The idea is to create different types of groups/communities for
                                    driverless cars.
                                    These communities consists of an array of different groups like, Go green - for
                                    environmental enthusiasts, Nirvana - for Yoga fans, The Godfather - for movie buffs,
                                    Jimmy - for Jim Morrison fans etc., </p>
                                <p class="pb-15">An individual can sign up for a particular
                                    group(s) depending on his interests and get to meet people with similar interests.
                                    By signing up he/she would be entitled to some privileges and access to exclusive
                                    areas in regard with the community like free pass to some conference, concerts
                                    movies etc., The individual can also introduce new members by which he would gain
                                    few points which can be utilised for free drive or something. These communities can
                                    be city specifics and while leaving the city, the points gained by an individual can
                                    be transferred to someone else or can be utilised by joining the same community in
                                    other cities. </p>
                                <p class="pb-15">So, basically the intention these communities is to create
                                    connection and bond between people who are otherwise in their own cocoon. There
                                    should be regulatory to oversee that the communities are NOT created to wedge the
                                    cohesiveness fabric of society.</p>

                                        user and their relationship to transport and travel?</span></p>
                                <p class="pb-15"> The journey becomes more
                                    interesting than the destination. The travel time becomes interesting as it becomes
                                    an arena to meet likeminded people.</p>

                                <p class="pb-15">The only way to meet likeminded people with similar interest while
                                    travelling is only through signing up and using driverless vehicles.</p>

                                <p class="pt-15 pb-10"><span>Idea description</span></p>
                                <p class="pb-15">The idea is to provide the consumer a single bottle which could be
                                    refilled anywhere
                                    according to their convenience based on subscription. So, the consumer buys a
                                    bottled natural water to drink, once he consumes the waters, proceeds to scans the
                                    code embedded sticker at the bottom of the bottle with his mobile phone, downloads
                                    the app to registers and subscribe to a certain number of liters which needs to be
                                    consumed within a certain timeframe. (For example: 50 liters for one month time).
                                    And next time when he feels like drinking water, he could just go to the nearest
                                    Refiller tap to fill his empty old bottle. The Refiller tap is installed in every
                                    nook and corner of the city and this tap spot could be located with the help of the
                                    downloaded App. The consumer could refill how much ever liters he/she has subscribed
                                    for. First time, the consumer buys the bottle filled with natural water, once he
                                    drinks the water, he can fold the bottle flat vertically and keep it in the bag. The
                                    collapsible / accordion fold design of the bottle makes this possible. And next time
                                    when he wants to drink the water, he opens the Refill App, locates the nearest
                                    Refilling tap, pulls out the folded bottle from his bag, takes it close by the
                                    machine, the machine has a sensor which detects the bottle and the slot opens
                                    automatically. There is a hollow space with a tap on the top and a magnetic plate at
                                    the bottom. The bottle needs to be kept in a folded format only. The code at the
                                    bottom of the bottle sits perfectly on the magnetic plate and helps the machine to
                                    read the code and its corresponding details of the consumer, his subscription plan
                                    etc., and based on this, the machine automatically pulls up the bottle and fills
                                    water based on the size of the bottle. Here it needs to be noted, the consumer
                                    doesn't have the choice to decide on the quantity, for example, he cannot fill half.
                                    Here the filling is automated, once the bottle goes in, the machine pulls out and
                                    read the size and fills in accordingly. The filling hardly takes a minute to fill
                                    and the message appears on the black door. After few seconds, the door opens, the
                                    bottle is filled with fresh water. The consumer could do this repeatedly until the
                                    subscription exhausts. This subscription cost would be very less when comparing
                                    buying individual bottle every now and then. </p>
                                <p class="pb-15">what is it, how does it work, in home,
                                    out of home, what does the service look like, how does the water/packaging go from
                                    the provider to the end user (and back), This idea is primarily for outdoors, for
                                    people who are on the go. They don't have to carry the bottle of water from home,
                                    instead fill it as and when it is required. From the business execution side, FIVE
                                    main players would be integral part of it. 1) BOTTLE MANUFACTRERS - ideally two
                                    sizes of 1L & 2L bottles need to be made. As mentioned earlier, the bottle has to be
                                    in accordion style, where it could be folded flat vertically and this is possible by
                                    using Low Density Polyethylene materials. The branding on the bottle also needs to
                                    be done smartly in such a way the brand name is visible even when folded. 2) THE APP
                                    DEVELOPMENT TEAM, which plays a vital role by creating a technology which is
                                    integrated in three things - the bottom of the bottle, the App and in the vending
                                    machine which reads both the data and give the final output. This is the central
                                    team which needs to liaise with the bottle manufactures and the vending machine. So,
                                    they create a code sticker, gives it to the bottle maker to integrate. They also
                                    create circular magnetic plate which can read the data and gives it to the vending
                                    machine manufactures to fix it in the machine. And also create an App which could be
                                    downloaded. This concept is similar to the magnetic strip /chip in the credit card
                                    and how the swiping machine reads the data by just taping/ swiping on it 3) ReFILLER
                                    PORT - the vending machine has to take up a regular space of a tap and probably look
                                    like EV charging port. And interaction of the customer with the machine like the one
                                    similar one which they have with an ATM machine perhaps. The machine maker needs to
                                    collaborate with the technology team to get the magnetic plate integrate into it and
                                    the tap needs to operate based on the data reading. 4) CIVIL ENGINEERING - when
                                    deciding on the spot of vending machine, it needs to be noted they would require
                                    10ft x10ft space beneath the ground for storing water. So, the ground needs to be
                                    dug out and a underground tank built to store the water. The capacity could be
                                    around 10000 liters approximately. This tank would be covered permanently with just
                                    an outlet to fill the tank. the vending machine fixed on it. The tank could be
                                    filled as and when the water level goes below the mark. And last player, 5) FILTER
                                    MAKER - Before the water from the tank comes out through the tap, it needs to go
                                    through a filter which makes the water “ drink ready” . It has to be noted, the
                                    fresh water is not viable to be consumed directly, hence it needs to be filtered
                                    before it goes into the consumer's bottle. Finally, the disposal of the bottle - It
                                    is similar to the SIM/credit card. They could always replace the existing bottle
                                    with the new one for a nominal price in any of the retail store, this could be
                                    little less than buying a new bottle.</p>
                                <p class="pb-15">The moment the new one is activated the old
                                    one becomes obsolete. How the idea help the company to tackle the concerns a
                                    consumer is facing?” - g. concerns on convenience, concerns on sustainability, etc
                                    The idea solves couple of issues at both individual level and environmental level.
                                    Every time the consumer buys a bottle, it creates a burden on the individual as well
                                    as the planet. This single bottle concept negates the production of unnecessary
                                    plastic bottles. Imagine not having to produce million of plastic bottles. And
                                    another thing is the accordion fold bottle, which is a great space saver, easy to
                                    carry and of course very convenient. Why this solution is the best option to future
                                    proof their business?” This concept makes the consumer subscribe to a plan which is
                                    technically a subscription to the brand. Let us imagine, if a person subscribes to
                                    50 liters of water, this means he is guaranteed to buy 50 bottles from the brand in
                                    the future. He would in no way be instigated to go for another brand of natural
                                    water since he has already subscribed to this plan and by all means, he would stick
                                    to the brand as he has already paid for it. And the subscription could be made more
                                    attractive, like when the consumer has exhausted say 40L out of 50L, then an
                                    attractive offer could be custom made for him via app, to subscribe for more, for
                                    example, subscribe for 50L more and get 70L. This is like mobile subscription; the
                                    consumer would not so easily move away from the brand. This makes the consumer a
                                    customer for life probably. The subscription is applicable irrespective of the
                                    cities/place.</p>

                                        <p class="pb-15">In our day to day life, we use the phrase like “Take a shower”
                                            Now, the new
                                            body wash experience is so overwhelming in fragrance that a woman no more
                                            “TAKE” a shower instead they WEAR a shower. During the shower, the fragrance
                                            of this new body wash engulfs the woman totally, and probably shower effect
                                            stay with them. Hence the inference “Wear a Shower”.</p>
                                            <p class="pt-15"><span>What is the new experience?</span></p>
                                <p class="pb-15">A woman decides to take a shower. She gets into the shower
                                    enclosure. She turns on the shower. Take out the body wash pack and as
                                    squeezes out a few drop of it an overwhelming fragrance engulfs the shower
                                    enclosure.</p>

                                <p> Soon, the rounded glass shower enclosure transforms into a
                                    rounded perfume bottle with the woman indulging herself in the fragrance of
                                    shower inside it.</p>
                                <p class="pb-15">As we all know, fragrance from a few drop of perfumes last a long time,
                                    so, imagine
                                    the experience of getting immersed in a full bottle of perfume. That would be the
                                    experience the new body wash would bring. The idea is to show how the shower
                                    enclosure becomes a Perfume bottle. Because of the overwhelming fragrance of the
                                    body wash. The entire body wash time would be like, being immersed in a perfume
                                    bottle - courtesy the fragrance of the body wash liquid.</p>
                                <p class="pb-15">The shower enclosure is
                                    shown as a perfume bottle. With the new body wash, the shower is not TAKEN, but WORN
                                    like a perfume. The Inference is that the fragrance of the shower is as good as
                                    wearing a perfume as or if not better.</p>

                                        <p class="pb-15">The greatest problem women face during periods is protection
                                            against leakages. The idea address those worries with a campaign called “The
                                            positive protection. No Drop of worries”. In one form, it addresses the
                                            leakage problem, in other form, it creatively infers that women do not have
                                            to drop a single tear over this issue as they have positive protection
                                            provided by the brand. In the word “drops” the letter “O” is designed as a
                                            drop with an X-mark placed inside it to indicate “NO”. The poster shows a
                                            young, confident ballet dancer in one of the difficult poses, with her hands
                                            holding her opposite legs crossing each other to create an X sign which is a
                                            symbolic connection to the sign in the headline.</p>

                                    <div class="col-md-6">

                                        <p class="pb-15">The model is shown doing a ballet dance because it is a dance
                                            form that requires utmost precision, skill and flexibility. It essentially
                                            show how the model is confidently doing the most difficult and flexible act
                                            without any worries as she is confident of the product not letting her down
                                            under any circumstance. It show the trust and utmost reliability she has on
                                            the product</p>
                                        <p class="pb-15"> Ballet dance is a much difficult form of dance. The ballerina
                                            model too will be a huge inspiration. A lot of honesty, discipline, and hard
                                            work goes into to becoming one. She is looked up to in the society for the
                                            commitment towards the art. Apracticing ballerina is revered and respected
                                            for her skill and discipline. So, the general thought will be, if a ballet
                                            dancer who can't afford to be careless, can trust this brand so can I.</p>

                                <p>Create a sign board in front a 24 hour Pharmacy store. The board design would be
                                    black background with some scattered dots with the Enfagrow logo. The headline says,
                                    “Dots connect at night. And at the night time, the scattered dots starts to connect
                                    with each other to form the image of a brain. This gets repeated the whole night in
                                    a loop. This is essentially to reinforce the idea of how the child's brain is
                                    decoding everything at night. A new mom's who see this sign board the core message
                                    of how the brain is growing at night and the importance of nutritious food
                                    (Enfragrow). This realisation would change her behaviour positively toward Enfrgrow.
