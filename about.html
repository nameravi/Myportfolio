                        <h4><span>THE SHORT</span> STORY</h4>
                        <p>With over 15 years of experience in advertising, I have successfully led omnichannel
                            campaigns across industries such as banking, FMCG, automobiles, real estate, and healthcare.
                            Over the past 10 years, I have specialized in pharmaceutical and medical advertising,
                            working with global clients, to create strategic and results-driven campaigns.
                        </p>
                        <p> Beyond creativity, my role involves business strategy, ideation, and execution, ensuring
                            that every campaign is designed to drive engagement, enhance brand presence, and achieve
                            measurable
                            business growth. I have led large teams to develop innovative campaigns that have boosted
                            brand visibility, increased market share, and delivered strong ROI for clients. </p>
                        <p>My dedication to pushing creative boundaries has earned me 13 Eyeka awards, a recognition
                            that likely makes me the only Indian to achieve this milestone. These accolades highlight my
                            ability to blend strategic thinking with creativity, crafting campaigns that not only
                            inspire but also deliver tangible business impact.</p>

                        <p>Most people have the perception that life science and creativity are poles apart and it is
                            true to a certain extent. While regular advertising essentially sells aspirations with the
                            emphasis on storytelling, creating an emotional trigger to nudge the consumer to make a
                            purchase decision, but medical advertising operates within a stricter framework due to
                            regulatory guidelines. The creativity is often constrained by compliance and should be
                            strictly factual and evidence based, include disclaimer, and avoid exaggerated claims.</p>

                        <h6>The Challenge & Satisfaction of Medical Advertising</h6>
                        <p>Medical advertising is one of the most challenging spaces for creativity—every idea must
                            navigate a maze of regulations, scientific accuracy, and ethical considerations. Unlike
                            traditional advertising, where storytelling can be free-flowing, here, every word, visual,
                            and claim must be meticulously crafted to comply with stringent guidelines. Yet, this very
                            challenge makes the process incredibly rewarding. Successfully maneuvering through these
                            constraints to create compelling, insightful, and impactful campaigns is a triumph in
                            itself. The satisfaction of delivering a campaign that not only meets compliance but also
                            resonates with HCPs and patients, making a real difference in people's lives, is what makes
                            medical advertising truly fulfilling.</p>

                        <h6>Redefining Omnichannel marketing</h6>
                        <p>For years, I have been deeply involved in omnichannel marketing for pharma, witnessing its
                            transformation from traditional multichannel strategies to a more integrated, data-driven
                            approach. What started as simple digital extensions of offline campaigns has now evolved
                            into highly sophisticated, personalized engagement models that connect HCPs and patients
                            seamlessly across multiple touchpoints.</p>
                        <p>Now, we are taking it a step further by integrating
                            AI technology into omnichannel marketing—a first-of-its-kind approach, especially in the
                            pharma industry. This revolutionary integration allows for hyper-personalized engagement,
                            predictive targeting, and seamless cross-platform execution, setting a new benchmark in how
                            pharma brands connect with HCPs. It's an exciting evolution, redefining the way marketing is
                            done and proving that AI is the future of omnichannel success.</p>
